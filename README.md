## About
*Logic State* is a language for describing deterministic state machine that later can be used to generate code or just transpile it into another format. This project is more focus on how to describe state machine universally that can be used in another language/platform rather than drawing a diagram. For drawing non_deterministic state machine ([NFA][]), please use specialized drawing-language like [Graphviz][], [Mermaid][], or [State Machine Cat][].

### Philosophy
- **Readable** just like you read then visualize a state diagram
- **Writeable** just like you write code which is concise, clear, and can be refactored
- **Transferable** to any implementation (e.g platform, programming language, runtime, etc)
